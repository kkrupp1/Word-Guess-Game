# Word-Guess-Game

This is a simple hangman game that uses math.random to select out of a pre-defined array of star wars characters.

The application then pushes an underscore for each character of the array selection, so when the user starts typing they can see how many characters they have left. 

All right answers are pushed to replace the underscore, as well as a "right guess" box.

Wrong answers are pushed to the wrong answer box.

As soon as you type the last correct letter, the user is alerted that they have won, and to play again they can refresh the page.

The fundamental logic of this application revolves around pushing to and referencing empty arrays. 

Have fun!
